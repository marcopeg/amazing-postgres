## Run the Project

This project simulates a PostgreSQL extension with its own unit tests.  
Run the following commands to run it:

```bash
# Build the "pgtap" image and start PostgreSQL with Docker
make start

# Build the project and run the unit tests
make test

# Build the project and populate it with dummy data
# so that you can play with it using a client like PSQL
make seed

# Stop the running PostgreSQL and remove the container
# (data is still persisted to the local disk)
make stop
```

## Generate PushIDs

```sql
-- Generate a PushID using timestamp in milliseconds:
select * from pushid_ms();

-- Generate a PushID using timestamp in microseconds:
select * from pushid_mu();
```
